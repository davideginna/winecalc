3 calcolatori

1 DIAMMONIUM PHOSPHATE (PRE-FERMENTATION) ADDITION
input 
Initial measured level of YAN mg/L
Required level of starting YAN mg/L
Volume of ferment or Quantity of ferment L oppure kg

risultato g

note: 
This calculator determines the amount of DAP needed to increase YAN by a given amount, assuming 1 mg/L of YAN is equivalent to approx. 4.7 mg/L of DAP.
This calculation is valid when YAN level has been pre-determined prior to or at harvest and before onset of fermentation. A YAN analysis can be carried out within one week before harvest.
Total YAN should not exceed 400 mg/L since yeast might fail to consume more than this amount.
The minimum requirement of YAN for a risk free fermentation of clarified juice under anaerobic conditions should exceed approx. 150 mg/L (reviewed by Bell & Henschke 2005, AWRI reprint #875).
The YAN content of a juice should be determined by chemical analysis before making a DAP addition. Contact AWRI’s Analytical Service for further information.
If YAN is <150 mg/L, DAP should be added before inoculation to ensure adequate formation of yeast biomass.
This formula does not take into account the ratio of juice to solids (grape skins, seeds, etc.).

2 DIAMMONIUM PHOSPHATE (NH4)2HPO4 ADDITION
input 
Amount of DAP required mg/l
Volume of ferment or Quantity of ferment L oppure kg
risultato g

note:

This calculation is useful for adding DAP to a fermenting must.
If H2S is detected during the first half of fermentation up to 100 mg/L of YAN (approx. 500 mg/L of DAP) can be added, but note that not all yeast strains respond to DAP addition.
H2S that is produced during the late stages of fermentation does not respond to DAP addition.
DAP additions should be made with care since:
Residual nitrogen can stimulate growth of spoilage yeast following fermentation.
Residual phosphate increases the phosphate content of wine, which should not exceed 400 mg/L as phosphorus. Note that 1.7 g/L DAP is equivalent to 400 mg/L phosphorous, when calculating total phosphorus, take into account juice/must phosphate content.
This formula does not take into account the ratio of juice to solids (grape skins, seeds, etc.).

3 THE YAN EQUIVALENCE OF DIAMMONIUM PHOSPHATE
input 
Enter either measurement to convert it

Amount of YAN mg/l
Amount of DAP mg/L
questo è un convertitore. converte YAN in DAP e viceversa. se si compila entrambi i campi input la coversione prevalente è YAN in DAP

note
This calculation assumes approx 4.7 mg/L of DAP is equivalent to 1 mg/L of YAN.
Yeast assimilable nitrogen (YAN), when measured chemically, is usually reported as the sum of free amino nitrogen concentration of primary amino acids (FAN) (excluding Proline) and ammonium nitrogen concentration:
YAN (yeast assimilable nitrogen) = FAN (free amino nitrogen) + Ammonium nitrogen

There is considerable literature on the use of DAP and its implications on fermentation, contact the AWRI for advice and assistance on developing the correct management strategy applicable to your requirements.
