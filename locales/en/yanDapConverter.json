  "info": "This calculation assumes approx 4.7 mg/L of DAP is equivalent to 1 mg/L of YAN. Yeast assimilable nitrogen (YAN), when measured chemically, is usually reported as the sum of free amino nitrogen concentration of primary amino acids (FAN) (excluding Proline) and ammonium nitrogen concentration: YAN (yeast assimilable nitrogen) = FAN (free amino nitrogen) + Ammonium nitrogen. Enter either measurement to convert it. If both values are entered, YAN to DAP conversion takes precedence.",
