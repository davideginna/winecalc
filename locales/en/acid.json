  "info": "Tartaric acid (L(+)-tartaric acid) is the primary acid used in European winemaking for acidity correction. When making additions to a red fermentation, this formula does not take into account the ratio of juice to solids (grapeskins, seeds, etc.). Standard addition: 1 g/L increases total acidity by approximately 1 g/L.",
