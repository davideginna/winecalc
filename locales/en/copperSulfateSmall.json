  "info": "Copper sulfate is used to remove hydrogen sulfide (H₂S) and mercaptans from wine. This calculator is for small-scale trials (glass, bench trial). IMPORTANT NOTES: • Dilute copper sulfate in water, drip into tank which is rummaging with gas • Additions should be based on sensory requirements • When attempting to remove H₂S towards the end of the fermentation, it is preferable to add Copper Sulfate rather than DAP • This formula assumes 3.93 parts of copper sulfate is equivalent to 1 part of Cu2+ • Verify any additions by follow-up analysis",
