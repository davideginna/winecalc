IMPORTANT NOTES: • This calculation is valid when YAN level has been pre-determined prior to or at harvest and before onset of fermentation • A YAN analysis can be carried out within one week before harvest • Total YAN should not exceed 400 mg/L since yeast might fail to consume more than this amount • The minimum requirement of YAN for a risk free fermentation of clarified juice under anaerobic conditions should exceed approx. 150 mg/L • The YAN content of a juice should be determined by chemical analysis before making a DAP addition • If YAN is <150 mg/L, DAP should be added before inoculation to ensure adequate formation of yeast biomass • This formula does not take into account the ratio of juice to solids (grape skins, seeds, etc.)",
